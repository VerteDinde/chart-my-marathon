# TO DO

## Data
* Pull all data from marathon, not just page 1
* Figure out how to scrape with a single-page app 
* Calculate averages of all data:
    * Finish time
    * Average pace
    * Age
    * (Gender isn't really hard; we can do that first)
* Automate those calculations (since we're pulling around 20,000 runners)

## Charts
* Adjust x and y -axis
* Determine how to adjust time (ex: by mile? 5k and 10k and 13.1?).
* Plot the following:
    * All times
    * Average time
    * My time/age/gender

## Write Up
* Write data explanation
* Create additional HTML page for explaining process
* Track process and problems
* Write process and (interesting) problems
